# Polyphemus

Polyphemus is the one-eyed giant, son of Poseidon, which is not relavent to this program at all. It is Facial Recognition program which can, like the name suggests, detect faces. The code was taken from pyimagesearch.com, but I plan to edit it to my needs. Thanks a lot to Dr. Adrian for the code.

Plus, the code is pretty inaccurate at the moment.
